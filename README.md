const wrapper = promiseCached({
	ttl: 10 * 1000 // Cache lasts for 10 seconds
});

// This is a very slow function that returns same response, every time, for same params
const sleepAndReturn = (message) => {
	return new Promise((resolve) => {
		setTimeout(() => {
			resolve(message);
		}, 1000)
	});
}

// This function acts just like one above, exept it is very fast after the first time
const cachedFunction = wrapper(sleepAndReturn);

cachedFunction("ðŸ’ª").then(() => {
	console.log("This took 1s");

	cachedFunction("ðŸ’ª").then(() => {
		console.log("This was instant! ");
	});
});
